His research is centered around building techniques, tools and environments that will ultimately help us build more reliable and secure software. He is interested in finding solutions that will allow programmers to debug their code in an easier way. In this regard, he strives to find efficient ways to detect, classify and perform root cause diagnosis of bugs. He is also interested in efficient runtime instrumentation and program analysis under various memory models.
