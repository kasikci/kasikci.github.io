I am a final year PhD candidate in the Dependable Systems Laboratory [(DSLAB)](http://dslab.epfl.ch/) at EPFL, advised by [George Candea](http://people.epfl.ch/george.candea). My research is centered around building techniques, tools and environments that will ultimately help us build more reliable and secure software. I am interested in finding solutions that will allow programmers to debug their code in an easier way. I strive to find efficient ways to detect, classify and perform root cause diagnosis of bugs. I am also interested in efficient runtime instrumentation and program analysis under various memory models.

I am one of the four recipients of the <a href="https://labs.vmware.com/academic/vmware-2014-2015-graduate-fellowships" target="_top">VMware 2014-2015 Graduate Fellowship</a>.

During my PhD, I interned at Microsoft Research, VMware and Intel. Before starting my PhD, I worked as a software engineer for four years, mainly developing real-time embedded systems software. Before joining EPFL, I was working for <a href="http://www.siemens.com/corporate-technology/en/index.php">Siemens Corporate Technology</a>.
