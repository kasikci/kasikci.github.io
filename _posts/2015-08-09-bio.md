I am a researcher in the [Systems and Networking Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/cambridge-systems-and-networking/) at Microsoft Research Cambridge. I completed my Ph.D. in the Dependable Systems Laboratory [(DSLAB)](http://dslab.epfl.ch/) at EPFL, advised by [George Candea](http://people.epfl.ch/george.candea). My research is centered around developing techniques, tools, and environments that help developers build more reliable, secure, and efficient software. I am interested in finding solutions that allow programmers to better reason about their code, and that efficiently detect bugs, classify them, and diagnose their root cause.  I am also interested in system support for emerging hardware platforms, efficient runtime instrumentation, hardware and runtime support for enhancing system security, and program analysis.
 
I am the recepient of the 2016 [Roger Needham PhD Award](http://www.eurosys.org/awards/needham-award) for the best PhD thesis in computer systems in Europe and the 2016 Patrick Denantes Memorial Prize for best PhD thesis in the Deparment of Information and Communication Sciences at EPFL. I am one of the four recipients of the <a href="https://labs.vmware.com/academic/vmware-2014-2015-graduate-fellowships" target="_top">VMware 2014-2015 Graduate Fellowship</a>.

During my Ph.D., I interned at Microsoft Research, VMware, and Intel. Before starting my Ph.D., I worked as a software engineer for four years, mainly developing real-time embedded systems software. More details can be found in my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}public/cv.pdf">CV</a>.
