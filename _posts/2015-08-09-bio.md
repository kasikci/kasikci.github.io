I am an Associate Professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington. Previously (2017-2023), I was a a Morris Wellman Assistant Professor in the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department](http://eecs.umich.edu/) at the [University of Michigan](http://umich.edu/). My research focuses on building efficient and trustworthy computer systems. I build techniques to improve the efficiency of datacenter applications, provide systems support for heterogeneous computing platforms, analyze and fix failures, and improve the security of modern hardware. Building efficient and trustworthy systems requires a combination of approaches. My work draws insights from a broad set of disciplines such as systems, computer architecture, and programming languages.

I am the recipient of an [NSF CAREER award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1942218), a [Microsoft Research Faculty Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/faculty-fellowship/#!fellows), an [Intel Rising Star Award](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/blogs/intel-rising-stars-awards-2020.html), a [VMware Early Career Faculty Grant](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/stories/baris-kasikci-earns-vmware-early-career-grant), a [Google Faculty Award](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/announcing-2019-google-faculty-research.html), and multiple Google and Intel Awards. I received the 2016 [Roger Needham PhD Award](http://www.eurosys.org/awards/needham-award) for the best PhD thesis in computer systems in Europe and the 2016 Patrick Denantes Memorial Prize for best PhD thesis in the Department of Information and Communication Sciences at EPFL. Previously, I was a researcher in the [Systems and Networking Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/research-area/systems-and-networking) at Microsoft Research Cambridge. I also held roles at Intel, VMware and Siemens. More details can be found in my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}public/cv.pdf">CV</a>.
