I am an assistant professor in the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Department](http://eecs.umich.edu/) at the [University of Michigan](http://umich.edu/). My research is centered around developing techniques, tools, and environments that help developers build more reliable, secure, and efficient software. I am interested in developing techniques and building systems that allow programmers to better reason about their code. I am also interested in system support for emerging hardware platforms, efficient runtime instrumentation, hardware and runtime support for enhancing system security, and program analysis.

I am the recipient of an [NSF CAREER award](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1942218), a [Google Faculty Award](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/02/announcing-2019-google-faculty-research.html), and multiple Intel Awards. I received the 2016 [Roger Needham PhD Award](http://www.eurosys.org/awards/needham-award) for the best PhD thesis in computer systems in Europe and the 2016 Patrick Denantes Memorial Prize for best PhD thesis in the Department of Information and Communication Sciences at EPFL. Previously, I was a researcher in the [Systems and Networking Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/cambridge-systems-and-networking/) at Microsoft Research Cambridge. I also held roles at Intel, VMware and Siemens. More details can be found in my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}public/cv.pdf">CV</a>.

I work/worked with the following group of outstanding and inspiring people:

**PhD students**: [Tanvir Ahmed Khan](http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~takh/), [Kevin Loughlin](https://www.kevinloughlin.org/), [Andrew Loveless](http://andrewloveless.com/), [Jiacheng Ma](https://jcma.me/), [Ian Neal](http://about.iangneal.io/), [Gefei Zuo](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~gefeizuo/) 

**Undergraduate students**: Nathan Brown, Yineng Yang, Dexin Zhang

**Former PhD students**: [Dr. Ofir Weisse](http://www.ofirweisse.com/)

<span style="color:red"><b>!! NEW !!</b></span> I am looking to fund a post-doctoral researcher to work at the intersection of low-level program analysis and security.
